# kdbxtofirefox

## Introduction
This little project helps to import the passwords from firefox to kdbx and also from kdbx to firefox.
As i noticed recently the kdbx csv export cannot be imported to firefox therefore i made this tool to create 
a compatible csv to be imported to firefox

## Usage
Dont forget to install requirements ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
After installing requirements you can run the kdbxtofirefox.py.
Basic example ```python kdbxtofirefox.py --input /path/to/kdbx.csv --output /firefox/csv/output.csv```
